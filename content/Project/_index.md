# Heart Failure Prediction Project

## üìã Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict mortality risk in heart failure patients using clinical data. By analyzing various medical indicators, we aim to develop a robust predictive model that could assist healthcare professionals in risk assessment and patient care optimization.

## üéØ Objectives

1. Develop an accurate prediction model for heart failure mortality
2. Identify key clinical indicators that influence patient survival
3. Create a reliable tool for healthcare professionals
4. Contribute to evidence-based medical decision making

## üìä Dataset Description

The analysis utilizes the Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, comprising medical records of 299 patients with heart failure.

### Dataset Specifications
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Size**: 299 patient records
- **Features**: 12 clinical features + 1 target variable
- **Quality**: Complete dataset with no missing values

### Clinical Features Analysis
