# ðŸ“ˆ Data Visualizations

In this section, we'll explore various visualizations that help us understand our patient survival dataset better. Each visualization provides unique insights into different aspects of our data.

## ðŸ“Š Patient Survival Distribution
A clear visualization of the patient survival outcomes in our dataset. This bar graph provides an immediate understanding of the dataset's balance between survival cases.
